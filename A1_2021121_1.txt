Yes, I agree that countering someone's claim with our idea will never influence his thought.
An argument is when someone puts his claim about something based on his understanding of the topic, and  If we try to correct someone and condemn their ideas, they would probably justify themselves and charge us in return. This will never end until one of us stops the conversation.

Also, it is meaningless to object to someone's perspective of seeing something; indeed, if someone,s claims something based on a wrong fact, we should explain to them the actual truth instead of trying to win the war of arguments.
For example
Russia vs. Ukraine war 
Some think Russia is doing wrong by invading Ukraine and killing many innocent civilians.
On the other side, some think Russia is doing this for its security and defending itself from nato.
Now on this topic, we can see people playing argument wars on social media like youtube, Instagram, etc, having no proper knowledge about the things going on.
